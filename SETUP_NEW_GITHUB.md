# GitHub Repository Setup Complete

## What has been done:

1. ✅ **Added your new GitHub repository as origin:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/ahmedmustafaux/cequens-newux.git
   ```

2. ✅ **Updated the repository URL in package.json**

3. ✅ **Updated the clone URL in README.md**

## Final step:

Just push your changes to the new repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - cleaned up v0 and old GitHub references"
git push -u origin main
```

## What was cleaned up:

✅ Removed `V0_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`
✅ Removed v0-specific build scripts (`build-spa.sh`, `build-fixed.sh`)
✅ Removed v0 deployment files (`public/vercel.json`, `public/_redirects`, `public/.htaccess`)
✅ Removed old GitHub remote origin
✅ Updated `.gitignore` to remove v0-specific entries
✅ Added placeholder for new repository URL in `package.json` and `README.md`

Your project is now clean and ready for your new GitHub repository!
